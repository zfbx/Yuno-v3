## About
She's back! Well, she was never really gone but I did make version 4 of Yuno closed source and I've decided it was time for a rewrite with all the changes coming to the Discord API so here we are with a fresh start!

## Who Is Yuno?
Yuno (Yuno Gasai) is base off a character from an Anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Honestly I just really like the character and thought she'd be a great theme for the discord bot :)
